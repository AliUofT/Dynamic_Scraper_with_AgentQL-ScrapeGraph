The intertwining of some aspects of North American economies with NAFTA, and later the USMCA prompted and yet were incapable of handling the massive displacements they generated. While it may be true the solution lies outside of trade deals, and even nation states, with the ethical response an elimination of borders, this talk will focus in the meantime on the potential for more creative and humanitarian responses within the existing policy frameworks, an anti-NAFTA within the existing tri-national policy environment. Centering lived experiences of those directly impacted by NAFTA will enable better, more grounded policy design, even while acknowledging that the existing national policy landscapes continue to generate and sustain structural inequalities and harm.",

            "description": "_Otherworld_ is the first major solo museum exhibition by Camille Turner in Toronto. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, and currently living and working between Los Angeles and Costa Rica, Turner is widely recognized for her transformative examination of Black history in the Canadian national narrative. Working in performance, photography, installation, digital and sonic media, often in collaboration with others, Turner’s immersive exhibition continues her long-standing and wide-ranging exploration of Canada’s entanglement in the histories of the transatlantic trade of enslaved Africans. The newly commissioned exhibition _,__Otherworld_\n_,_ immerses the visitor in a non-linear Afro-Astronautic journey transcending space-time boundaries. Recognizing historical silences as both information and direction, Turner’s Afronautic research methodology takes the visitor deep into the archive, uncovering the traces and legacies of enslavement that extend from named enclaves of urban wealth in Toronto to the shipbuilding industry in Newfoundland. Filled with personal recollections and stories of immeasurable loss, the exhibition walks us back to the portals of departure and arrival of those forcibly taken from the shores of West Africa and dispersed throughout the Americas, and those lost in the passage between. Camille Turner’s work takes its inspiration from Afrofuturism; looping in and around time, it offers places of recovery and dreams of a liberated future. On their journey, the visitor is invited to listen to stories contained in the geologic time of displaced rocks and sea-worn sticks resembling bones, finding there the potential of changing history and, powered by the imagination, to make worlds otherwise.",

It is becoming increasingly important for researchers to be able to clearly communicate their research to a broader audience, such as the public, the press, and even funding organizations. However, communicating complex specialized findings in an understandable and general manner is challenging for many researchers. This workshop provides attendees with practical strategies on how to achieve this goal. Participants will engage with numerous interactive elements and activities in the session and a provided workbook will be available for the attendees to download before the workshop to further guide and deepen participants’ learning.

            "description": "The post–World War II period is typically seen as a time of stark division, an epochal global conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. But beneath the surface, the postwar era witnessed a striking degree of international cooperation. The United Nations and its agencies, as well as regional organizations, international nongovernmental organizations, and private foundations brought together actors from conflicting worlds, fostering international collaboration across the geopolitical and ideological divisions of the Cold War. Diving into the archives of these organizations and associations, Sandrine Kott provides a new account of the Cold War that foregrounds the rise of internationalism as both an ideology and a practice. She examines cooperation across boundaries in international spaces, emphasizing the role of midsized powers, including Eastern European and neutral countries. Kott highlights how the need to address global inequities became a central concern, as officials and experts argued that economic inequality imperiled the creation of a lasting peace. International organizations gave newly decolonized and “Third World” countries a platform to challenge the global distribution of power and wealth, and they encouraged transnational cooperation in causes such as human rights and women’s rights. Assessing the failure to achieve a new international economic order in the 1970s, Kott adds new perspective on the rise of neoliberalism. A truly global study of the Cold War through the lens of international organizations, A World More Equal also shows why the internationalism of this era offers resources for addressing social and global inequalities today.",

Describing a governmental approach that simultaneously incentivizes a can-do spirit and suppresses dissent, the book points out resonances between authoritarian and neoliberal ideologies in today's comeback of strongman rule. Drawing on field observations, in-depth interviews, and analyses of video clips, it conveys the look and feel of flexible authoritarianism in Russia through the eyes of up-and-coming youth. The author analyzes ways in which the insignia of cool start-up capitalism and familiar cultural forms such as the summer camp help stabilize the regime, while also showing how up-and-coming youth both embrace and contest loyalty to the government.",

            "description": "The presentation will examine the understudied topic of Ukrainian POWs from the Imperial Russian army detained in Central Powers camps and their repatriation, which occurred at a pivotal moment of geopolitical shifts and national revival, both in Ukraine and in the camps. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, efforts of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine led to the formation of the Blue- and Grey-Coated divisions from a few hundred patriotic Ukrainian POWs. For around 40,000 Ukrainian POWs, imprisonment continued well beyond post-war settlements due to the enduring violence in Central and Eastern Europe and the communist threat. Ukrainian repatriation missions, hindered by diplomatic and financial obstacles, faced difficulties in securing evacuation routes. Drawing on primary sources from Library and Archives Canada and archives in Ukraine, Germany, Austria, and Poland, this presentation will reveal the complex efforts, hardships, and shifting allegiances that shaped Ukrainian POWs’ repatriation, providing insights into the broader struggles for freedom and identity in early 20th-century Europe.",

            "description": "Sometime around 1980, in the United States as well as in a range of other high-income countries, a new economic geography began to emerge. Under this new pattern, rewards have been lavished upon highly educated workers living in a group of increasingly large, prosperous cities. At the same time, gaps in welfare and opportunity separating these ‘superstar’ cities from the rest of the urban system have grown. This has created the impression of a deep polarization between winners and ‘left behind’ places. Despite growing attention from academic researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, the reality of 21st century urbanization remains insufficiently well understood. In this talk, Dr. Tom Kemeny will outline the problem across multiple dimensions, including incomes, social mobility, wealth, and housing. He argues for an explanation centered on two major forces: epochal technological innovation, and fundamental changes in land supply. This account contrasts with a dominant, supply-side narrative about location and equality, in which changes in zoning rules can enable prosperity for all. Instead, the view he will articulate points to a future of persistent polarization in the American system.",

About the Book: THIS WASN'T ON THE SYLLABUS illuminates the courageous stories of campus activism against sexualized violence in Canada, uniting over three decades of personal accounts and resistance in a powerful call to prioritize and amplify the voices of student activists worldwide. This book is both a record and an act of protest, progress, and survival within Canada’s post-secondary landscape. The collection features personal accounts which articulate not only the prevalence of sexualized violence on campus, but how these acts inspire students to activism. The book is a call to value and prioritize the voices of student activists, who are often among those most impacted by sexualized violence, and who are key participants in driving change.

While the Ministry of Education, Faculties of Education, and Boards of Education increasingly prioritize social justice, many parents are concerned about basic education. For example, the Ontario Human Rights Commission found that our schools are failing to teach children to read! Many parents perceive a lack of access to education experts. Others feel that these experts are unwilling to persuade them of the benefits of new approaches. To address these perceptions, LaurierHxA has arranged for three education experts, each with different views, to discuss the direction of K-12 education.",

They inspire artists, treasure hunters, and a substantial tourism industry for wreck diving. Yet, there s a part of their story we dont usually hear about: the potential for environmental pollution. In 2017 the UK Ministry of Defence tasked an interdisciplinary group of historians, oceanographers, chemists, and ecologists to investigate and prioritize the risk of oil pollution from ships that had been sunk in the North Sea during the first and second world war. A fascinating and challenging task, since there was no method, guideline, or even previously published research on how to do what they were asking for. In this seminar, I would like to discuss the approaches, questions, challenges, and - quite frankly - fun we had figuring out how to make decisions about 100 year old ships at the bottom of the ocean.",

This Joan is a non-binary person, fighting for their freedom as well as for France’s liberty from English rule, fueled by their utter belief in their mission (and its divine support), curbed by a small-minded establishment, but ultimately triumphant. A gloriously counterfactual, rivetingly theatrical rethinking of history by one of the most exciting voices in contemporary drama.",

After the performance there will be a session Q & A about the performance and the team’s iterative creative process. Co-created by Matthew Cumbie and Tom Truss, _ReWritten_ reflects on the intimate relationship between nineteenth-century American writers Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne to explore queerness, history, intimacy, and the written word. The relationship between Hawthorne and Melville has been characterized as one of the most mysterious and fruitful friendships in American letters, yet the letters from Hawthorne to Melville are missing. _ReWritten_ springs from this historic gap and time-hops between then and now as an attempt to expand how we see ourselves in these stories. Through performances and community engagements, _ReWritten_ weaves together dance, music, visual art, projection, and text, and reimagines an intergenerational queer love story. Since 2019, _ReWritten_ artists have been coming together to create and cultivate this iterative, multi-disciplinary performance project. Over the years, _ReWritten_ has included residencies at the Bethany Arts Center (NY), Texas State University, Colby College (ME), Salem State University, the University of Texas El Paso, the Berkshire Pulse (MA), Dance Place (DC), and the international conference of the Melville Society (Paris, FR); site-specific explorations of Herman Melville’s farmhouse Arrowhead, developed in partnership with the Berkshire County Historical Society; workshops with local libraries and community centers; and more. This semester the _ReWritten_ project is coming to the University of Toronto as part of a collaboration with a University of Toronto Mississauga English & Drama course. This is possible through the generous support of the Jackman Humanities Institute Program for the Arts; The Centre for the Study of the United States Bissell-Heyd Research Fellowship; The University of Toronto Mississauga Office of the Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation; and the UTM and UTSG Departments of English.",

This resulting uncertainty can create challenges in navigating the lawful use of these technologies for research and teaching. This workshop will introduce participants to questions that arise when integrating approved and non-approved GenAI tools into research and teaching. From there, the workshop will segue into a more focused discussion on copyright, using case studies to guide the conversation. By participating in the workshop, participants will gain a better understanding of the copyright and licensing concerns that govern the use of GenAI tools, as well as the library eResources that are available to support GenAI use. Along the way, participants will become familiar with: * U of T-recommended best practices for the use of open or closed GenAI tools, and the suitability of various kind of content in open or closed environments * Key copyright and licensing terminology to help participants understand their rights and obligations (and those of their students) * Answers to some common AI copyright and licensing questions.",

            "description": "Two time Chalmers-award winner Daniel Bard was born in Haifa, Israel, where he began his violin studies. He moved with his family to Toronto in 1990 and then studied with David Zafer. He also worked with Lorand Fenyves in Toronto, Peter Oundjian in the US, and David Takeno in London, U.K. Daniel co-founded Trio Mondrian, a group that played together from 2007-2019. The trio received first prize at the 2007 International Chamber Music Competition in Trieste, Italy, and performed in prestigious venues including Wigmore Hall, Concertgebouw and La Fenice in Venice. Trio Mondrian has been named a BBT fellowship winner in 2009. Daniel is also a founding member of the Israeli Chamber Project, a chamber group active in both Israel and the USA. One of the biggest passions of Daniel is the chamber orchestra. He has been invited by Tabea Zimmermann to guest lead Camerata Bern, and since then directed numerous projects with Sweden’s Camerata Nordica and Norway’s Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. He was principal violist of the Amsterdam Sinfonietta from 2009 to 2016. In 2017, Daniel became concertmaster of the Basel Chamber Orchestra in Switzerland where he performed “Meta Arca” by Heinz Holliger with the composer conducting. In April 2018 Daniel performed the Dutch premiere of John Woolrich’s “Ulysses Awakes” with the Amsterdam Sinfonietta. Recently, Daniel has been invited by Iván Fischer to be guest concertmaster of the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Equally at home as a violinist and violist, Daniel is invited to play chamber music concerts all across Europe and Israel. He has collaborated with artists such as Menahem Pressler, Antje Weithaas, Shmuel Ashkenzi, Tabea Zimmermann, and performed in festivals such as Prussia Cove, Musikdorf Ernen and Peasmarsh Music Festival. Lastly, Daniel enjoys greatly sharing his passion for music-making with the next generation. He has lead both instrumental and chamber music classes at the Amsterdam Conservatory and at the chamber music sessions of the Jerusalem Music Centre. Daniel plays on a 2020 violin made by Paul Belin from Maintal and a James Tubbs bow generously gifted to him by the late Bud Beyer, a great and inspiring mentor.",

            "description": "Years ago, the medieval practice of pilgrimages was intended to cleanse the mind and prepare the spirit. Travel from the Goran Heights to the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem, along the path to Santiago de Compostele and across Turtle Island, such arduous physical travel was then and now thought to prepare the individual for an inward journey towards a better self. Even as we tread on the same worn stones, across the Seas we hear the echoes of those who sang, their voices rippling across as thousands of deaths. We may ask and wonder if the architecture of the human heart has really changed so much. Daniel Taylor and Andrew Balfour join together to lead this sacred event featuring magnificent yet neglected composers. Ispiciwin, meaning “Journey,” embarks on an unprecedented musical exploration at the faculty, bridging cultures and perspectives.",
